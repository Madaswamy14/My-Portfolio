## Jira Overview

Jira is a project management tool teams use to plan, track, and manage their work. Jira is flexible, allowing teams to configure various methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, and Kanban.

Key benefits of Jira include:

  * Centralized work tracking provides a single point of reference for all tasks, bugs, and user stories.
  * Improved collaboration facilitates communication and transparency among team members.
  * Visual workflows allow teams to visualize their work process and identify bottlenecks.
  * Powerful reporting offers insights into team performance and project progress.

  * **Project**: A container for the work of your team in Jira. It groups related tasks or issues.
  * **Issue**: A basic unit of work in Jira. It can represent a task, a bug, a user story, or any other work item.
  * **Board**: A visual representation of the workflow of your team. To track progress, issues move across columns on the board from To Do to Done.
  * **Workflow**: A set of statuses and transitions an issue moves through during its lifecycle, from creation to completion.
